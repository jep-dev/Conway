### `obj`

This directory contains binaries, objects (compiled as `.o`), which are not
executable or complete without 3rd party libraries. They are generated by GNU
Make via Makefile, which is configured to use GCC and emit x86 Linux binaries.
It can theoretically be reconfigured, but the project and 3rd party libraries
may not be portable and are not yet tested on other environments. For more
information on portability and requirements, see the readme in the parent
directory.

<i>
This is one of several README files used to track directories that would otherwi
se be ignored, since they store derivative files excluded by .gitignore, but are
 necessary for these derivative files to be created. The best alternative is dir
ectory sentinels, but there are caveats regarding portability of directory creat
ion. The current approach exposes the directory structure to version control dir
ectly, so that changes are documented in the repository history and the current 
state and purpose is documented inherently.
