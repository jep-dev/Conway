### bin

`bin` contains executable binaries and may contain supporting scripts in the
future. The only current executable is the result of compiling and linking
the sources and headers in this project, dynamically, to 3rd party libraries
such as SFML2.

This is one of several README files used to track directories that would otherwi
se be ignored, since they store derivative files excluded by .gitignore, but are
 necessary for these derivative files to be created. The best alternative is dir
ectory sentinels, but there are caveats regarding portability of directory creat
ion. The current approach exposes the directory structure to version control dir
ectly, so that changes are documented in the repository history and the current 
state and purpose is documented inherently.
